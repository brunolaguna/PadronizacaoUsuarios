# PadronizacaoUsuarios
This repository will contain a program for the standardization of users in Genesys, for my team (that's why it's in Portuguese). This program will read each line of the "textarea" to put it inside a vector and then each index will concatenate with the string of the vector (the string is part of importing users in Genesys), then just import it to the Genesys cloud.
